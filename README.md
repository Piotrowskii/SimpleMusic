# Introduction

This app was mainly created as a way to learn Flutter, but also for my own personal use, and it works well enough for me. I don‚Äôt plan to make major updates or improvements, as I‚Äôd like to move on to other projects. For fun (and the experience), I also designed the app icon and Play Store screenshots.
